"""S3 helper utilities (optional shared library).

Artifacts and datasets are often stored in object storage (Amazon S3) in
production. This module is a placeholder for shared, well-tested S3 helpers,
such as:
- upload/download with retry/backoff,
- local cache management,
- standardized bucket/prefix conventions for model artifacts.

This file is documented so future contributors know where S3 logic should live.
